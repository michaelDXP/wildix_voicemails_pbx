# wildix_voicemails_pbx
Community Project:
Very simple PHP/MYSQL starter Code for the community to play with and improve. A voicemail counting wallboard for Wildix virtual and HW PBX from the CDR database.

Displays the extension and number of voicemails for "Today" - easily configurable for different scenarios.
The users are added dynamically as they recieve a Voicemail, if they do not have voicemails 
for the given day they do not appear.
The code should be fully responsive.
The values refresh every second - you can change this in the index.php to a slower rate if required.
